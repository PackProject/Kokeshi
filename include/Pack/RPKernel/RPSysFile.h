/**
 * @brief Disc file loaded into RAM
 * @details Similar to EGG's DvdFile structure,
 * except this class expects the file's data to already have been loaded into
 * RAM.
 *
 * Paths are relative to the project root (i.e. `"Common/Kokeshi/common.carc"`)
 *
 * In theory this class could be used for all open files, but the resource
 * manager seems to only use it for archives post-decompression. Perhaps it
 * "simulates" the existence of data only in memory as a file?
 *
 * This class has an additional ut::Node so that the resource manager can keep
 * track of all open files. It removes itself from the resource manager's file
 * list (at 0x10) on destruction.
