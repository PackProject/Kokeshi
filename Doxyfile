# Doxyfile 1.9.3

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Kokeshi"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         =

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "Pack Project mod framework"

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify a logo or an icon that is included
# in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55
# pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy
# the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           = docs/logo.png

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = build/docs

# The STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the
# path mentioned in the documentation of a class, which tells the reader which
# header file to include in order to use a class. If left blank only the name of
# the header file containing the class definition is used. Otherwise one should
# specify the list of include paths that are normally passed to the compiler
# using the -I flag.

# KOKESHI: Includes are relative to the 'include' directory.
STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH    = include/MSL/ loader/ include/ lib/

# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that act as commands in
# the documentation. An alias has the form:
# name=value
# For example adding
# "sideeffect=@par Side Effects:^^"
# will allow you to put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the
# documentation, which will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading
# "Side Effects:". Note that you cannot put \n's in the value part of an alias
# to insert newlines (in the resulting output). You can put ^^ in the value part
# of an alias to insert a newline as if a physical newline was in the original
# file. When you need a literal { or } or , in the value part of an alias you
# have to escape them by means of a backslash (\), this can lead to conflicts
# with the commands \{ and \} for these it is advised to use the version @{ and
# @} or use a double escape (\\{ and \\})

# The NUM_PROC_THREADS specifies the number threads doxygen is allowed to use
# during processing. When set to 0 doxygen will based this on the number of
# cores available in the system. You can set it explicitly to a value larger
# than 0 to get more control over the balance between CPU load and processing
# speed. At this moment only the input processing can be done using multiple
# threads. Since this is still an experimental feature the default is set to 1,
# which effectively disables parallel processing. Please report any issues you
# encounter. Generating dot graphs in parallel is controlled by the
# DOT_NUM_THREADS setting.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 32, default value: 1.

# The LAYOUT_FILE tag can be used to specify a layout file which will be parsed
# by doxygen. The layout file controls the global structure of the generated
# output files in an output format independent way. To create the layout file
# that represents doxygen's defaults, run doxygen with the -l option. You can
# optionally specify a file name after the option, if omitted DoxygenLayout.xml
# will be used as the name of the layout file. See also section "Changing the

# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

# If the CLANG_ASSISTED_PARSING tag is set to YES then doxygen will use the

# index structure (just like the one that is generated for HTML Help). For this
# to work a browser that supports JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required
# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom style sheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine tune the look of the index (see "Fine-tuning the output"). As an
# example, the default style sheet generated by doxygen has an example that
